    "longDescription": "React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It was developed by Facebook and is now maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React allows developers to build reusable UI components and manage the state of an application in a way that makes it easy to reason about and debug. It also integrates well with other libraries and frameworks, such as Redux for state management and React Router for client-side routing. React is widely used in web development and has been used to build many popular websites and web applications, such as Facebook, Instagram, and Airbnb.",
